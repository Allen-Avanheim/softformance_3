Python Task #3

Build a Python-based web crawler, which will recursively walk over the website and download all images from its pages and then convert it all into one single format. Which format? Pick it yourself, it might be jpg, png, etc. But make sure all the images from the website are converted to a single format.

You can use almost any python library. 

Take into account that the website might also keep images in .svg format or ‘picture’ format and in that case, these images should also be converted single selected format (png or jpeg).

You can pick whatever small website you want to test your project code.

We’ll test it using a random website URL.
